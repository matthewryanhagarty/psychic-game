// <!-- make a variable letterOption with a value of array of letter options <A-Z>

// why? this is going to help us generate a random 

// variable wins initially set to 0

// variable loses intiation set to 0

// variable guessesLeft intitally set to 9.

// variable guessedLetters which is initially set to an empty array

// ________________________

// actions/ functions

// adding letters that to guessedLetters array (adding arguement of a letter)

//     - takes letters guessed and pushes into guessedLetters

// decrement guess count

//     - checks to see if guesses remaining is 0
//     - if not, decrement down by one guesses guessesLeft
//     - 0, increase loses by 1
//     - lose game/ restart

increment wins
    - if the correct letter is selected, then wins goes up by 1 (reset) - must define reset in a function

increment losses
    - if the guess count goes = 0, then increment loss count by 1 (reset)
    - a loss is defined as guesscount = 0

guesses so far 
    -when the user guesses a letter, it needs to be pushed to the guessed letters Array
    -this needs to be displayed on the screen --- 
    
    point.innerHTML | var "name" = document.getElementByID("ID NAME")

if

else

    if 

.innerHTML
//     event.onkeyup 

//         - check to see if key pressed is equal to computer guess
//         - if not, add it to lettersGuessed
//         -check to see if guessCount
//             -if is, increment loses, reset game
//                     - set guesses back to 9
//                     - empty the guess array -->

Computer picks a random letter
    the random letter is going to come from the alaphabet Array
